# ðŸ“– User guide

The visualisation interface relies on floating windows to arrange the available
viewport.

In order for the users customize their workspace, the position for each
floating window is saved to browser storage.

Following a minimalistic approach, each window can be toggled to be hidden or
shown by interacting with the [menu](./menu) icons.
