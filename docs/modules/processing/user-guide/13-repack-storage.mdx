# Repack storage

:::warning
Currently, this command is exclusively available on <UbuntuIcon /> Ubuntu
systems.
:::

When you frequently overwrite your <StorageIcon /> storage file, the space
previously occupied by the deleted dataset isn't immediately freed due to HDF5
technology's workings.

Repacking enables the creation of a new file containing your data but optimized
for the smallest possible size.
