# Repack storage

<Fragment>
  :::warning
  Currently, this command is exclusively available on <UbuntuIcon /> Ubuntu
  systems.

  When you frequently overwrite your <StorageIcon /> storage file, the space
  previously occupied by the deleted dataset isn't immediately freed due to HDF5
  technology's workings.

Repacking enables the creation of a new file containing your data but optimized
for the smallest possible size.
