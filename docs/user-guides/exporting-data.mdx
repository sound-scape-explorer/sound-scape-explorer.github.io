title: How to export data

The visualisation app allows exporting data to `.csv` files for external
analysis.

Most panels include an export button that downloads the currently displayed
data.

:::tip
Exported filenames use the following naming convention:

`SSE - [extraction name] - [band name] - [integration name] - [reducer name] - [export type]`

You can opt out from the view details in the general settings.

## Scatter exports

Click the export button in the scatter controls to download:

- Interval indices
- Timestamps
- Sites
- Tags
- Coordinates (from reducers)
- Embeddings (from extractors)

:::info
Scatter exports will always exclude hidden points.
:::

## Temporal exports

Export acoustic indicator values as CSV directly from the Temporal panel (see
[Temporal filtering](./filtering-data/#temporal-filtering)).

:::info
Printed values are always scalars,
corresponding to the aggregation method (mean, min, max).
:::

## Heatmaps exports

Export heatmap data showing tag value distributions.

## Trajectory exports

Export trajectory path coordinates and timestamps.

If multiple trajectories are shown, they will get concatenated in the `.csv`.

If you enabled the average function for multiple trajectories, they will
appear as a single `fused` entry in the `.csv`.

## Relative Trajectory exports

Export relative trajectory statistics showing how trajectories move relative to
a reference point over time.

For each trajectory, the CSV contains:

- **Median distance**:
  Median normalized distance from the reference point across all computation
  iterations
- **Lower decile (P10)**:
  10th percentile of distances (showing lower bound of variation)
- **Upper decile (P90)**:
  90th percentile of distances (showing upper bound of variation)
- **Timestamps**:
  Time points for each measurement

:::info
Distances are normalized by the mean distance to the 100 nearest neighbors of
the reference point, making trajectories comparable across different datasets.

The reference point is calculated as the average of all trajectory starting
positions within the same tag group.
