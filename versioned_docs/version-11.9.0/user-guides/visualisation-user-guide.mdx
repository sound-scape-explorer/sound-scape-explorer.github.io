# Visualisation user guide

<ContextWarning />

## Compatibility

While the web app is compatible with most browsers, we experienced random
issues with Firefox on Windows 11 and Safari on macOS 14. Thus, we
recommend using Chrome.

## <VisCommandInline/> command

> <VisCommandInline /> is only available if you have installed the `Processing`
> module.

This is the quickest command to start both `Audio` and `Front` modules.

On an active `venv` shell window, type the following to start both services
(replace the path to your configuration file by drag and dropping the file
Excel icon into your shell):

<VisCommandBlock />

After pressing `<Enter>`, both modules will start and your default browser will
open.

> **Note**
>
> You can also use <VizCommandInline/> or `viz` as aliases to the <VisCommandInline/> command.

## `audio:front` command

You can serve both `Front` and `Audio` modules at the same time

```bash
# Windows
pnpm audio:front:windows Z:\audio_folder_example

# Ubuntu / macOS
pnpm audio:front relative/or/absolute/path/to/audio/folder
```

## `audio` command

Serve `Audio` module on port [5531](http://localhost:5531)

```bash
pnpm audio -- relative/or/absolute/path/to/audio/folder
```

## `front` command

Serve `Front` module on port [5530](http://localhost:5530)

```bash
pnpm front
```
