## Most frequent use case

If you want to execute all the requested metrics declared in your configuration
file, please use the `Run All` menu choice.

1. Select `Run All`
2. Wait for the processing to complete. When the menu displays again, the
   processing has completed
3. You can now go further to [visualisation user
   guide](./visualisation-user-guide) in order to display your data

## Menu

You will get the menu below.

Use you `arrow` and `Enter` keys to navigate through it.

### Refresh configuration command

Digest your Excel configuration file and copy all its information inside
your storage file.

> **Note**You will need to run this again if you change your configuration file.

### Run extractions and aggregations command

Extract data from your audio files either through neural networks or indicators algorithms.

Take the raw data and aggregate them using your integration settings.

> **Note**These raw data can optionally be stored with the `persist` option.

### Run reductions command

Take the aggregated data produced by neural networks and reduce them using your
reducers settings.

### Run computation UMAPs and mean distances matrix command

Run the necessary data for autoclusters to be performed.

Those data will never be read in the `Front` so you can use the purge command
to remove it from your storage file.

### Purge computation UMAPs and mean distances matrix command

Remove computation data from your storage file as it will not be consumed by
the `Front`.

### Run autoclusters command

Automatically attribute numerical clusters (groups) of intervals that are
related together depending on your settings.

These clusters will appear in the `Front` as standard labels.

### Run trajectories command

Compute the coordinates of the requested trajectories.

### Run digests command

Take aggregated data and produce derived data using digesters algorithms.

### Run all command

Run all the commands necessary for a complete campaign.

### Export dataframe command

Exports all intervals and associated data to a `.csv` file.

### Export computation UMAPs command

Exports all computation UMAPs to a `.npy` file.

### Export mean distances matrix command

Exports the mean distances matrix to a `.npy` file.

### Repack storage command

When you overwrite a lot to your storage file, the space that was occupied
by the deleted dataset is not immediately freed. This is due to how the
HDF5 technology works.

Repacking allows you to create a new file with your data but with the smallest
possible size.

> **Note**This command is only available on UNIX systems at the moment.On Debian based distributions, install it with```bashsudo apt install hdf5-tools
>
> ```
>
> ```

### Quit command

When the `Processing` module is running, your storage file is kept open thus
not available to other programs to reading from it.

Use this to properly close and release your storage file.
