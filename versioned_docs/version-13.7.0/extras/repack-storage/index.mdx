<Fragment>
  When you frequently overwrite your <StorageIcon /> storage file, the space
  previously occupied by the deleted dataset isn't immediately freed due to HDF5
  technology's workings.
</Fragment>

Repacking enables the creation of a new file containing your data but optimized
for the smallest possible size.

## 🛠️ Procedure

<Fragment>
  Navigate to where your <StorageIcon /> storage file is located.
</Fragment>

Then run:

```bash
h5repack old_storage.h5 new_storage.h5
```
