In our ongoing efforts to enhance communication and transparency between the business and development teams, I am pleased to announce the implementation of a new centralized documentation portal for the SoundScapeExplorer project. This portal serves as a comprehensive hub for all project-related documentation, updates, and other pertinent information. It is designed to function as a showcase for the platform, providing a convenient space to publish evolving documentation for upcoming versions while archiving the older ones. Additionally, it facilitates easy export of documentation in PDF format, enabling offline access for your convenience. I invite you to use and share the following link to others:sound-scape-explorer.github.io Your feedback on this initiative is highly valuable, and I encourage you to share any thoughts or suggestions you may have. Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to further advancing our collaboration through improved access to project information.
