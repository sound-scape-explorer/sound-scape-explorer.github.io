# Sound Scape Explorer v14.0 Released

After months of development, we're excited to announce Sound Scape Explorer
v14.0 - a complete architectural overhaul with major improvements to usability,
performance, and stability.

## What's New

### JSON Configuration (Finally!)

The biggest change: **Excel spreadsheets are gone**. Campaign configuration now
uses JSON files with a modern React-based interface featuring guided workflows
and contextual inline help. This enables:

- Step-by-step guidance reducing cognitive load
- Better validation and error messages
- Version control friendly configurations
- Programmatic campaign generation
- Easier sharing and collaboration

Legacy v13 `.xlsx` configurations can still be imported through the new Campaign
module.

### Expanded Neural Network Support

Processing now supports multiple neural extractors:

- **VGGish**
- **PERCH**
- **SurfPERCH**
- **YAMNet**
- **BirdNET**
- **Music Classifier**
- **Plus scikit-maad acoustic indices** for traditional analysis
- **Automatic model downloading** via Kaggle and GitHub integration

Multiple extractors can be concatenated in a single extraction for richer
embeddings.

### Modern Tech Stack

**Processing CLI:**

- Migrated to Python 3.11
- Replaced PyTorch with TensorFlow (with CUDA/Metal acceleration support)
- New CLI flags: `--validate`, `--auto`, `--cpu`, `--memory`
- Better handling of configuration errors and OOM events
- Improved performance and memory management

**Visualisation:**

- Spatial selection boxes for 3D filtering
- Enhanced audio player with dynamic spectrograms
- Better heatmap interactions for data exploration
- Improved scatter coloring with acoustic indicators
- Redesigned UI components

**Standalone app:**

- Running all other modules: Campaign, Audio, Visualisation
- Electron 39 upgrade with Wayland support on Linux

### Quality of Life

- Comprehensive documentation with screenshots and video tutorials
- Automatic update notifications in standalone app
- Rewritten trajectory implementation with improved visualisation
- Consistent Leq values in dBFS

## Breaking Changes

v14 uses a completely new configuration format and storage structure. Key
changes:

- Configuration files are now JSON instead of Excel
- Storage paths and HDF5 structure have been updated
- Python 3.11 required (up from 3.10)
- Datasets **must** be regenerated with the new Processing CLI

The Campaign module includes a migration tool for importing v13 `.xlsx`
configurations.

## Testing and Quality

This release includes comprehensive test coverage:

- End-to-end Playwright tests for UI interactions
- Processing pipeline integration tests
- CI/CD automation for cross-platform builds
- Security vulnerability patches throughout the stack
